# Mobile-Price-Prediction-by-using-SVM
The motivation behind this project is to predict the price range of a mobile phone, based on its features such as Random Access Memory(RAM), internal memory, battery power, and others by using the art of machine learning algorithm. The aim of this work is not about predicting the actual price of a mobile phone, (i.e. it is not a regression problem) but it predicts the price range which is either low (0), medium(1), high(2) and very high (3). Five machine learning algorithms including Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na√Øve Bayes, and others were tested to find the one with the highest prediction accuracy that will be used as a final prediction machine learning model for this problem. Finally, the SVM attain the best estimator score of approximately 97% prediction accuracy.
